/*
  # Update delete_user_completely function to remove user from team rosters

  1. Changes
    - Modifies the `delete_user_completely` function to remove the deleted user ID from all team rosters
    - Uses array_remove to clean up the roster arrays in the teams table
    
  2. Security
    - Maintains existing security model (admin-only access)
    - Function continues to run with SECURITY DEFINER
