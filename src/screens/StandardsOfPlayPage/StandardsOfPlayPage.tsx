                Each tier has 3 teams who all play a total of 4 sets (2 each against opposing teams). The team with the most wins moves up a tier, team with second best record stays and team with third best record moves down a tier. Tiebreakers will be determined by head-to-head result, points for/against, then total points between the 2 teams. If still tied, previous week&apos;s standings will determine team&apos;s positioning. In case of a three-way tie, we use points for/against, then total points of all 3 teams. If still tied, previous week&apos;s standing will come into effect. When a team forfeits in a 3 tier, points will be scored as 0 pts and the other two teams will receive 21 pts per set. The remaining two teams will play their two sets as per the original schedule.
