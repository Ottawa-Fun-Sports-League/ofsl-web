feat(schedule): movement, no-games, reset rollback, refactor

- Next-week movement with row creation, precise clearing, immediate A/B/C placement
- Centralize score submission + movement services; both modals call shared flow
- Edit-safe: clear only affected teams’ placements before reapplying
- Reset: rollback standings deltas; clear next-week placements for the tier
- Per-tier no-games: carry forward A/B/C; skip full no-games destination week
- Weekly no-games: bump placements to next week; on uncheck, move back
- Adjacency: treat neighbor no-games as temp top/bottom boundaries
- DB: relax positional constraints (A/B/C) via migrations
- UI: fix unique key warning in summary
