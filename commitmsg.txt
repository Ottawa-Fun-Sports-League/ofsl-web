chore: comment out VITE_DEBUG_MOVEMENT and finalize weekly movement

- Comment VITE_DEBUG_MOVEMENT in .env (keep for local debugging when needed)
- Wire weekly no-games toggle to server RPCs (apply_week_bump_auto / apply_week_rewind_auto) with client fallback
- Fix duplicate destWeek declaration in scheduleDatabase
- Keep submission movement simple with next playable week skip; remove per-tier auto carry-forward
