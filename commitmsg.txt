feat(scorecards): wire weekly score submission + standings updates; add edit window, saving state, and prefill

- Persist weekly results per tier with match_details JSON and league_points
- Update standings cumulatively; subtract prior week/tier before applying edits
- Enforce previous-week-only edit window; allow admins/facilitators to submit
- Show Completed when results exist; swap Submit/Edit/View dynamically; remove duplicate text
- Add admin Reset scores action per tier (deletes results, clears completion)
- Align standings UI (points highlight) and show + for positive differentials

build(db): add migrations for scoring + cascade

- add match_details and facilitator policies (game_results manage)
- restrict weekly_schedules manage to admins only
- add league_points to game_results for precise adjustments
- ensure ON DELETE CASCADE on league FKs (scores, schedules, standings)

refactor(ui): enhance scorecard with prefill and Saving state
