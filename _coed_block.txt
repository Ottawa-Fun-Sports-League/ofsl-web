OFSL facilitators will notify players to begin activities 10 minutes after schedule time and to stop activities at 10 minutes before the schedule time i.e. For games scheduled for 8:00-10:00 pm, start time will be at 8:10 pm &amp; end time at 9:50 pm. Note if a team is late, the order of play can be changed without penalty as long as the teams present agree to play, All 6 sets must be played within the time permitted.

                    Each tier has 3 teams who all play a total of 4 sets (2 each against opposing teams). The team with the most wins moves up a tier, team with second best record stays and team with third best record moves down a tier. Tiebreakers will be determined by head-to-head result, points for/against, then total points between the 2 teams. If still tied, use previous week&apos;s schedule position: higher-ranked on the schedule wins (A &gt; B &gt; C when in the same tier). In case of a three-way tie, we use points for/against, then total points of all 3 teams. If still tied, previous week&apos;s schedule position applies. When a team forfeits in a 3 tier, points will be scored as 0 pts and the other two teams will receive 21 pts per set. The remaining two teams will play their two sets as per the original schedule.
